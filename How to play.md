# How to Play
1. Run the game by executing main.py:
  bash: python main.py
2. Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.
3. The goal is to eat the red food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and your score increases.
4. If the snake collides with the wall or itself, the game resets, and your score is reset to zero.

# How It Works
- The snake moves continuously and responds to user input.
- Each time the snake eats food, a new segment is added to its body.
- The game keeps track of the score and high score, storing the high score in a data.txt file.
